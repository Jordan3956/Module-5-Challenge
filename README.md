- Being that the correlation between "mouse weight" and "average tumor volume" is .84 that leads me to the conclusion that there is a strong correlation between these two sets of data. What this strong correlation means is that when the weight of the mouse is high, the average tumor volume is high. All in all, I believed the weight of the mouse has very much to do with the volume of tumors in the mouse. 

- As for the associated drug regimen "Capomulin" and "Ramicane" stood out from the rest in the "average tumor volume" both with an average of around 40 as opposed to the rest of the regimens which didnt present an average under 52.

- As far as gender of the mice potentially playing a role in influencing the data, we can factor that out. Of all the mice tested there were 49% female and 51% male mice, which makes it an almost perfect balance of each gender.
